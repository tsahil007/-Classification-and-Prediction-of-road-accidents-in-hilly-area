## Importing Data and cleaning
- We import three files to perform analysis on this data. This data is consist of three files
that are accidents, casualities and vehicles. However, we have one more file which is general information
about the traffic count for year 2000 to 2015. We can use general traffic information data for machine learning part.
#### Machine Learning Conclusion
As we have tried three different algorithms to predict the accident severity. It was clear that Decision tree and Random Forest performed much better in terms of predicting all the classes of accident severity. Logistic regression has better accuracy but it does not mean it did better than other algorithm. We even tried multi-nomial to predict all the classes in hyperparameter tuning section. It still predicted only one of the higher occuring class.
